I've prchased GTA V PREMIUM online edition, comes with a bunch of shit. Now for some reason i cant get the rockstar launcher to even download on my PC and they are refusing to refund me for a game i've not even clocked 1 second on. If anyone is interested in it for cheap $20 paypal and its yours (currently $47? on steam while on sale)

The tech support 'experts' are really useless too and nothing they have asked me to try is working.

Also have a bunch of different game keys inluding Minecraft, FIFA, Cold War, and even some bundles like a Random PREMIUM 5 Keys for 5 premium steam games. 

All up for grabs for literally up to 80% off retail xx
